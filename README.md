Personal experiments in Computer Vision using DepthAI with an OAK-D camera, focusing on basic depth sensing and stereo vision.

## Initial Structure

- `depth-testing/`  
- `depthai-python/`  

## Requirements

- [x] OAK-D device  
- [x] USB 3.0 cable  
- [x] Python 3.8+ installed  
- [x] DepthAI Viewer  

## Purpose

Explore and test fundamental concepts in depth sensing and stereo vision using the OAK-D camera.  
The goal is to understand how DepthAI pipelines work, perform real-time depth capture, and experiment with custom processing for 3D perception and computer vision tasks.
